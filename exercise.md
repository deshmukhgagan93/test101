# Exercise

Clone your repository (its name is 'gagan.deshmukh').
Locally (on your computer), switch to (feature) branch

```sh
'feature110'
```

by (Git) checking it out. Switch to folder 'feature110' and create a new file

```sh
mydata.txt
```

Copy to it the below given data (cp. 'Data'), that appear between '[' and ']'
**not** including '[' and ']'. After that, (Git) stage, commit,
and push it. Check, if the green check mark appears in the Gitea Web application
at feature branch 'feature110'. If it appears, submit a *pull
request* via the Gitea Web application. Do **not** close or merge the pull request yourself.
Just open it. According to the *feature branch workflow pattern*, the maintainer of the repo
(this is your lecturer) has to review and merge it. Already closed or merged pull requests **will not be considered**.
